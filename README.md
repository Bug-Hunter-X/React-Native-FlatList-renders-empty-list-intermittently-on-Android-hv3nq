# React Native FlatList Intermittent Empty List on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug where a `FlatList` in React Native intermittently renders an empty list on Android devices, even when the data has been successfully fetched. The issue is not consistently reproducible but happens sporadically.

## Bug Description

A `FlatList` component is used to display data fetched from an API.  The data fetching is successful, as confirmed by logging, but the FlatList remains empty on occasion.  This behavior is specific to Android and doesn't seem to occur on iOS.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android emulator or device.
3. Observe that sometimes, the list renders correctly, but other times, it displays nothing even though the data is available.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper data handling and potentially using keyExtractor with a unique key.
